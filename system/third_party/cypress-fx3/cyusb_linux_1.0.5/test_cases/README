This directory contains code to generate sample data for testing purposes.

The program create will ask a few questions interactively and generate a sufficiently large
binary file with data. The data can be fixed or variable (random) and the random number seed
is generated using the gettimeofday() function to generate different random data every time,
or data can auto-increment from a start value until it rolls over at oxff.

You can use od -x <filename> to display contents in hexadecimal.
