                      Aardvark I2C/SPI Software
                      -------------------------

Introduction
------------
This document outlines the changes required to upgrade existing
software that is dependent on previous versions of the API.  Only
the changes between versions are given in the sections below.  New
features are addressed in the datasheet.

Please ensure that all older copies of the Aardvark library
(aardvark.dll or aardvark.so) are removed from your operating system
path before running your upgraded application.  This will help
prevent the wrong library from being loaded with your application,
thereby causing a version mismatch.


Upgrade from v4.00 to v5.00
---------------------------
- Changed Rosetta bindings for C#, .NET, VB.NET, and VB6 such that all
  arrays must be also accompanied by a separate length argument.  See
  the README.txt for details.

- Changed Rosetta bindings for C# to fix type specification for output
  arrays (arrays that are filled by the API function).  These arrays no
  longer need to be passed as "ref array_var_name".

- Changed aa_find_devices_ext function so that each array argument
  (devices and unique_ids) is preceded by its own individual length
  specification.  Please see Aardvark datasheet for the behavior
  when these lengths are not equal.

- Changed aa_spi_write function so that each array argument
  (data_out and data_in) is preceded by its own individual length
  specification.  Please see Aardvark datasheet for the behavior
  when these lengths are not equal.

- Added extra argument handling in Rosetta bindings for Python for API
  functions that accept array arguments.  This can help improve overall
  code execution performance.  See the README.txt in this archive for
  more information.



Upgrade from v3.30 to v4.00
---------------------------
- Changes to naming convention of certain types.  For example,
  AA_STATUS is now AardvarkStatus.

- Older Numeric type definitions with the "aa_" prefix are now
  deprecated.  For example, "u16" should be used in lieu of
  "aa_u16".


Upgrade from v2.50 to v3.00
---------------------------
- Changes to the parameter order of the following functions:

     int aa_find_devices (
         int      nmemb,
         aa_u16 * array
     );

     int aa_i2c_read (
         Aardvark     aardvark,
         aa_u16       slave_addr,
         AA_I2C_FLAGS flags,
         aa_u16       num_bytes,
         aa_u08 *     data_in
     );

     int aa_i2c_write (
         Aardvark       aardvark,
         aa_u16         slave_addr,
         AA_I2C_FLAGS   flags,
         aa_u16         num_bytes,
         const aa_u08 * data_out
     );

- Structure AA_VERSION has been changed to AardvarkVersion

- aa_log() takes a file descriptor instead of a FILE * stream

- Direct USB driver on both Windows and Linux eliminates any
  association with virtual USB serial ports

- Visual Basic, Python, Labview no longer require a separate DLL


Upgrade from v2.00 to v2.50
---------------------------
- No user-visible changes to the API
